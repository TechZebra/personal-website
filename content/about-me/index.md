My name is Ian Carey, and I'm excited to share a little bit about myself with you.

I am currently an IT Analyst by profession. I have a passion for all things tech and have a desire to specialize and focus on cloud technologies. Check out my [certification](https://iancarey.io/certifications) and [blog](https://iancarey.io/blog) pages to see what I've been working on and thinking about! I love diving deep into complex problems and finding innovative solutions to them. It's challenging work; but it's also incredibly rewarding to help organizations and more importantly, the people that do the work operate more efficiently.

When I'm not working my day job, I love to keep busy as a women's college basketball referee. I've always had a passion for the sport. Being a referee allows me to stay close to the game and develop skills that help me on and off the court. It's a thrilling experience and I'm constantly learning and growing in my role.

Another one of my passions is motorsports. I've been a fan of racing for as long as I can remember. I love Indycar, NASCAR and everything in between! I also enjoy racing simulations and have spent countless hours in games such as iRacing, Automobilista 2, and RFactor 2.

Last but not least, I'm a proud cat dad to my feline companion Whiskey. He brings so much joy to my life and I love nothing more than spending time with him and my wife.

In my free time, you can find me exploring new technology trends, catching up on the latest motorsports news, or spending quality time with my family and friends.

Thank you for taking the time to read about me. I hope this page gave you a glimpse into my interests and passions.
Happy browsing. :)
