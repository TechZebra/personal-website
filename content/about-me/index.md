My name is Ian Carey, and I'm excited to share a little about myself with you.

I am currently an IT Analyst by profession. I have a passion for all things tech and a desire to specialize and focus on cloud technologies. Check out my [certification](https://iancarey.io/certifications) and [blog](https://iancarey.io/blog) pages to see what I've been working on and thinking about! I love diving deep into complex problems and finding innovative solutions to them. It's challenging work; it's gratifying to help organizations and, more importantly, the people that do the job operate more efficiently.

I love to keep busy as a women's college basketball referee when I'm not working my day job. I've always had a passion for the sport. Being a referee allows me to stay close to the game and develop skills that help me on and off the court. It's a thrilling experience, and I'm constantly learning and growing in my role.

Another one of my passions is motorsports. I've been a fan of racing for as long as I can remember. I love Indycar, NASCAR, and everything in between! I also enjoy racing simulations and have spent countless hours in games like iRacing, Automobilista 2, and RFactor 2.

Last but not least, My wife and I are proud cat parents to our feline companion, Whiskey, who provides us with much joy and love.

In my free time, I like to explore new technology trends, catch up on the latest motorsports news, or spend quality time with my family and friends.

Thank you for taking the time to read about me. I hope this page gave you a glimpse into my interests and passions.

Happy browsing. :)
