My name is Ian Carey, and I'm excited to share a little about myself with you.

I am an IT Analyst working for a water utility. I am passionate about all tech and am presently exploring and becoming proficient in cloud technologies. Check out my [certification](https://iancarey.io/certifications) and [blog](https://iancarey.io/blog) pages to see what I've been working on and thinking about! I love diving deep into complex problems and finding innovative solutions to them. It's challenging work; it's gratifying to help organizations and, more importantly, those performing in their roles operate more efficiently.

I love to keep busy as a women's college basketball referee when I'm not working my day job. I've always had a passion for the sport. Being a referee allows me to stay close to the game and develop skills that help me on and off the court. It's a thrilling experience, and I'm constantly learning and growing in my role.

Another one of my passions is motorsports. I've been a fan of racing for as long as I can remember. I love Indycar, NASCAR, and everything in between! I also enjoy racing simulations and have spent countless hours in games like iRacing, Automobilista 2, and RFactor 2.

Lastly, my wife and I are proud cat parents to our feline companion, Whiskey. We love nothing more than spedning time together out on the deck on a nice day!

In my free time, I like to explore new technology trends, catch up on the latest motorsports news, or spend quality time with my family and friends.

Thank you for taking the time to read about me. I hope this page gave you a glimpse into my interests and passions.

Happy browsing. :)
