What's up, gang?

It’s been a while since my last post in 2023! A lot has happened since then! I’ve taken on a new role as a Systems Engineer at [Hanscom Federal Credit Union](https://www.hfcu.org), banished my sim rig to the attic, and decided to focus on improving my golf game. 

After many happy years at Pennichuck Water, I decided to make a change. After a long search, I got the chance of a lifetime to join the team at Hanscom Federal Credit Union. Since joining them in October 2023, I’ve had the pleasure of working with incredible technologies, have grown my skillset, and get to work with amazing people. And guess what? We’re hiring! Check out our openings [here](https://recruiting.ultipro.com/HAN1015HFCU/JobBoard/fba58347-e29f-4416-8e12-98236b8302e7/?q=&o=postedDateDesc)!

With other interests and my new job taking precedence over my time, I didn’t get to use the sim rig as much as I would have liked. I purchased my rig from [Advanced Sim Racing](https://www.advancedsimracing.com). While the rig itself is incredibly compact and well-built, I simply couldn’t justify the space it was taking up in my office. So, one weekend while my wife was away, I took it apart and placed it in our attic. It will likely make a return and get set up again, but that probably won’t happen until we move into a new place!

You know what they say, “Other interests” is basically a fancy way of saying golf! My grandparents introduced me to the game way back when, and I was hooked from the start. I played it all through my childhood, even into college. But then, a few years into college, I decided to focus on basketball officiating and left the golf world behind. It wasn’t until last summer that I picked it up again. And guess what? My wife and I absolutely love it! We recently joined a club, and I just had my first lesson with the head pro. Can you believe it? They figured out what was wrong with my swing in just two swings! Since it’s winter here, I’ve been practicing and playing on Trackman simulators. The technology is mind-blowing! It gives me all sorts of info to help me improve my game. Check out the video below for more details.

Until next time, be well!
