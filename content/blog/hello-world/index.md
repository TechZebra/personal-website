Well, this is cool! 

This isn't the first time that I've shared something online that nobody cares about, but it is the first time I'm doing it from my own website!

I decided to title this post "Hello World!" because I'm using a number of technologies for the first time to make it all happen.

1. The first is Markdown. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows me to format the text on this page using a simple syntax. I can do all sorts of neat things like this list! I can also insert a really simple code block like this:

```sh
hugo new site mysite
```

2. I've also dabbled in Hugo. Hugo is a popular open-source static site generator. It was created in 2013 and generates static HTML files, so no database is required for server side processing! You can learn more about Hugo by clicking [here](https://gohugo.io).

3. I have used Microsoft's cloud computing platform, Microsoft Azure before in various professional roles. This however, marks the first time using it in a personal capacity to host something! Best of all, hosting a static website like this is free! Wanna do the same for yourself? Check it out [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/overview)

4. Last, but certainly not least is my use of Github! I've browsed to Github before while surfing along the internet, but this is the first time I've created my own repo. Feel free to [check it out](https://github.com/techzebra)!

That's all for now! I hope to have a few of these articles every month. They wonâ€™t all be about technology, racing season is upon us here in the Northeast, and there is always something exciting to talk about.

Wanna chat? Feel free to send me an email or reach out to me on LinkedIn!

Happy Spring!
