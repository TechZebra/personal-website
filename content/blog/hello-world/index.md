Well, this is cool! 

This isn't the first time that I've shared something online that nobody cares about; it *is*, the first time I'm doing it from my own website!

I decided to title this post "Hello World!" because I'm using a number of technologies for the first time to make it all happen.

1. The first technology is Markdown. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows me to format the text on this page using a simple syntax. It can create things like this list and the code block below.

```sh
hugo new site mysite
```

2. I've dabbled in Hugo. Hugo is a popular open-source static site generator. It was created in 2013 and generates static HTML files so no database is required for server side processing. You can learn more about Hugo by clicking [here](https://gohugo.io).

3. I have used Microsoft's cloud computing platform Azure before in various professional roles. This marks the first time using it in a personal capacity to host something. Best of all, hosting a static website like this is free! Want to do the same for yourself? Check it out [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/overview)

4. Last, but certainly not least, is my use of Github! I've browsed Github and other repos while surfing along the internet; this is the first time I've created my own repo. Feel free to [check it out](https://github.com/techzebra)!

That's all for now! I hope to have a few of these articles every month. They wonâ€™t always be about technology. My posts may cover other intersets like basketball officiating and motorports.

Happy Spring!
