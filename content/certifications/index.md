Certifications like the ones below help me stay current with the latest technologies and trends in the industry. The majority of these certifications require ongoing training and education to maintain. This helps me stay up-to-date with the latest developments in the field. I’m currently studying to take Microsoft’s AZ-305 exam. When I complete this certification I’ll be a Certified Azure Solutions Architect Expert. More about this certification can be found on Microsoft's site [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/azure-solutions-architect/).
