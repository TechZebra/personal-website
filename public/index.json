Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows me to format the text on this page using a simple syntax. I can do all sorts of neat things like this list! I can also insert a really simple code block like this: hugo new site mysite I\u0026rsquo;ve also dabbled in Hugo. Hugo is a popular open-source static site generator. It was created in 2013 and generates static HTML files, so no database is required for server side processing! You can learn more about Hugo by clicking here.\nI have used Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s cloud computing platform, Microsoft Azure before in a various professional roles. This however, marks the first time using it in a personal capacity to host something! Best of all, hosting a static website like this is free! Wanna do the same for yourself? Check it out here\nLast, but certainly not least is my use of Github! I\u0026rsquo;ve browsed to Github before while surfing along the internet, but this is the first time I\u0026rsquo;ve created my own repo. Feel free to check it out!\nThat\u0026rsquo;s all for now! I hope to have a few of these articles every month. They won’t all be about technology, racing season is upon us here in the Northeast, and there is always something exciting to talk about.\nWanna chat? Feel free to send me an email or reach out to me on LinkedIn!\nHappy Spring!\n","date":"13 April 2023","permalink":"/blog/hello-world/","section":"Blog","summary":"and it begins\u0026hellip;","title":"Hello World!"},{"content":"","date":"13 April 2023","permalink":"/","section":"Ian Carey","summary":"","title":"Ian Carey"},{"content":"My name is Ian Carey, and I\u0026rsquo;m excited to share a little bit about myself with you.\nI am currently an IT Analyst by profession. I have a passion for all things tech and have a desire to specialize and focus on cloud technologies. Check out my certification and blog pages to see what I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on and thinking about! I love diving deep into complex problems and finding innovative solutions to them. It\u0026rsquo;s challenging work; but it\u0026rsquo;s also incredibly rewarding to help organizations and more importantly, the people that do the work operate more efficiently.\nWhen I\u0026rsquo;m not working my day job, I love to keep busy as a women\u0026rsquo;s college basketball referee. I\u0026rsquo;ve always had a passion for the sport. Being a referee allows me to stay close to the game and develop skills that help me on and off the court. It\u0026rsquo;s a thrilling experience and I\u0026rsquo;m constantly learning and growing in my role.\nAnother one of my passions is motorsports. I\u0026rsquo;ve been a fan of racing for as long as I can remember. I love Indycar, NASCAR and everything in between! I also enjoy racing simulations and have spent countless hours in games such as iRacing, Automobilista 2, and RFactor 2.\nLast but not least, I\u0026rsquo;m a proud cat dad to my feline companion Whiskey. He brings so much joy to my life and I love nothing more than spending time with him and my wife.\nIn my free time, you can find me exploring new technology trends, catching up on the latest motorsports news, or spending quality time with my family and friends.\nThank you for taking the time to read about me. I hope this page gave you a glimpse into my interests and passions. Happy browsing. :)\n","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/about-me/","section":"Ian Carey","summary":"My name is Ian Carey, and I\u0026rsquo;m excited to share a little bit about myself with you.","title":"About"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories"},{"content":"Certifications like the one below help me stay current with the latest technologies and trends in the industry.
