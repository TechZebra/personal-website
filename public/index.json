Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows me to format the text on this page using a simple syntax. It can create things like this list and the code block below. hugo new site mysite I\u0026rsquo;ve dabbled in Hugo. Hugo is a popular open-source static site generator. It was created in 2013 and generates static HTML files, so no database is required for server-side processing. You can learn more about Hugo by clicking here.\nI have used Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s cloud computing platform Azure before in various professional roles. This marks the first time using it personally to host something. Best of all, hosting a static website like this is free! Want to do the same for yourself? Check it out here\nLast but certainly not least is my use of Github! I\u0026rsquo;ve browsed Github and other repos while surfing the internet; this is the first time I\u0026rsquo;ve created my own repo. Feel free to check it out!\nThat\u0026rsquo;s all for now! I hope to have a few of these articles every month. They wonâ€™t always be about technology. My posts may cover other interests like basketball officiating and motorsports.\nDo you want to chat? Feel free to email me or reach out to me on LinkedIn!\nHappy Spring!\n","date":"13 April 2023","permalink":"/blog/hello-world/","section":"Blog","summary":"and it begins\u0026hellip;","title":"Hello World!"},{"content":"","date":"13 April 2023","permalink":"/","section":"Ian Carey","summary":"","title":"Ian Carey"},{"content":"My name is Ian Carey, and I\u0026rsquo;m excited to share a little about myself with you.\nI am an IT Analyst working for a water utility. I am passionate about all tech and am presently exploring and becoming proficient in cloud technologies. Check out my certification and blog pages to see what I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on and thinking about! I love diving deep into complex problems and finding innovative solutions to them. It\u0026rsquo;s challenging work; it\u0026rsquo;s gratifying to help organizations and, more importantly, those performing in their roles operate more efficiently.\nI love to keep busy as a women\u0026rsquo;s college basketball referee when I\u0026rsquo;m not working my day job. I\u0026rsquo;ve always had a passion for the sport. Being a referee allows me to stay close to the game and develop skills that help me on and off the court. It\u0026rsquo;s a thrilling experience, and I\u0026rsquo;m constantly learning and growing in my role.\nAnother one of my passions is motorsports. I\u0026rsquo;ve been a fan of racing for as long as I can remember. I love Indycar, NASCAR, and everything in between! I also enjoy racing simulations and have spent countless hours in games like iRacing, Automobilista 2, and RFactor 2.\nLastly, my wife and I are proud cat parents to our feline companion, Whiskey. We love nothing more than spedning time together out on the deck on a nice day!\nIn my free time, I like to explore new technology trends, catch up on the latest motorsports news, or spend quality time with my family and friends.\nThank you for taking the time to read about me. I hope this page gave you a glimpse into my interests and passions.\nHappy browsing. :)\n","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/about-me/","section":"Ian Carey","summary":"My name is Ian Carey, and I\u0026rsquo;m excited to share a little about myself with you.","title":"About"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories"},{"content":"Certifications like the ones below have helped me learn new skills and also validate the ones that I have.
