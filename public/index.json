Overall—really solid experience.\nOne of the highlights for me was hearing Glenn Allison from Tractor Supply Company speak. He walked through how they’re supporting hundreds of store locations with Nutanix, and what really stood out was how practical and down-to-earth his talk was. It wasn’t a sales pitch—just straight-up insight on what works and what doesn’t at scale.\nI also sat in on a Disaster Recovery session that helped clarify how Metro-Availability fits into the bigger picture. I’ve seen it mentioned plenty before, but this was the first time it really clicked. They covered not just the tech itself but how people are actually using it in real environments.\nAnother session I got a lot out of was from Reed Beaver at Dawn Foods, who talked about their move from VMware’s ESXi to AHV. With everything going on in the virtualization world, this one felt super relevant. He was honest about the challenges, but also really clear about why they made the switch and how it’s been going since.\nOne of the more unique parts of the week was getting to take part in the nuExperience session. I can’t really share the details of what was discussed, but what I will say is it felt good to be included. Even though I’m relatively new to Nutanix and managing a smaller environment, it never felt like my perspective didn’t matter. They really seemed to want input from users at all levels.\nAnd, as a bonus—D.C. had some great food. No complaints there.\nAll in all, .NEXT was definitely worth the trip. Left with a few ideas I’m looking forward to trying out, and a better handle on where things are headed with the platform.\nUntil next time,\nBe well!\n","date":"15 May 2025","permalink":"/blog/2025-05-15/","section":"Blog","summary":"What a trip!","title":"I've got .Next!"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/","section":"Ian Carey","summary":"","title":"Ian Carey"},{"content":"What\u0026rsquo;s up, gang?\nIt’s been a while since my last post in 2023! A lot has happened since then! I’ve taken on a new role as a Systems Engineer at Hanscom Federal Credit Union, banished my sim rig to the attic, and decided to focus on improving my golf game.\nAfter many happy years at Pennichuck Water, I decided to make a change. After a long search, I got the chance of a lifetime to join the team at Hanscom Federal Credit Union. Since joining them in October 2023, I’ve had the pleasure of working with incredible technologies, have grown my skillset, and get to work with amazing people. And guess what? We’re hiring! Check out our openings here!\nWith other interests and my new job taking precedence over my time, I didn’t get to use the sim rig as much as I would have liked. I purchased my rig from Advanced Sim Racing. While the rig itself is incredibly compact and well-built, I simply couldn’t justify the space it was taking up in my office. So, one weekend while my wife was away, I took it apart and placed it in our attic. It will likely make a return and get set up again, but that probably won’t happen until we move into a new place!\nYou know what they say, “Other interests” is basically a fancy way of saying golf! My grandparents introduced me to the game way back when, and I was hooked from the start. I played it all through my childhood, even into college. But then, a few years into college, I decided to focus on basketball officiating and left the golf world behind. It wasn’t until last summer that I picked it up again. And guess what? My wife and I absolutely love it! We recently joined a club, and I just had my first lesson with the head pro. Can you believe it? They figured out what was wrong with my swing in just two swings! Since it’s winter here, I’ve been practicing and playing on Trackman simulators. The technology is mind-blowing! It gives me all sorts of info to help me improve my game. Check out the video below for more details.\nUntil next time, be well!\n","date":"2 February 2025","permalink":"/blog/2025-02-02/","section":"Blog","summary":"Long time, no see!","title":"It's been a while."},{"content":"Spending the past few months diving into Microsoft Azure has been an absolute blast. I’ve enjoyed working in different labs, gaining knowledge and skills, and thinking about how to apply that knowledge to my current environment.\nAfter completing my first two Azure certifications and becoming a Microsoft Certified Azure Administrator, I was at a crossroads. I could either continue down the Microsoft path and gain more in-depth Azure knowledge or try another platform: AWS.\nI had several good friends within the “tech world” that I spoke to when making this decision. Ultimately, I was convinced to give AWS a shot and at least see what the world looked like outside of Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s ecosystem.\nEnter AWS Skill Builder. AWS Skill Builder is AWS’ repository of official training lessons to help you learn and refine your knowledge of AWS services. The video content and AWS Cloud Practitioner test exam were excellent preparation for the actual exam. Skill Builder also includes a game called “Cloud Quest.” Check out the video below!\nWhile I’m early in the training and learning process regarding AWS, I feel they have a real leg up on Microsoft here. Microsoft Learn is an incredibly robust platform with a ton of good information. Still, no live labs were included in the Azure certification training paths I participated in. I’d like to see Microsoft step up and offer more to individuals who want to train and learn.\nDue to these differences, I feel as though I made the right choice by jumping in to learn about AWS. I look forward to completing more labs and challenges within AWS Skill Builder and Cloud Quest.\nUntil next time,\nBe well!\n","date":"11 May 2023","permalink":"/blog/2023-05-11/","section":"Blog","summary":"Another quest starts!","title":"Playing Games and Getting Certified."},{"content":"Well, this is cool!\nThis isn\u0026rsquo;t the first time I\u0026rsquo;ve shared something online that nobody cares about; it is, the first time I\u0026rsquo;m doing it from my website!\nI decided to title this post \u0026ldquo;Hello World!\u0026rdquo; because I\u0026rsquo;m using several technologies for the first time to make it all happen.\nThe first technology is Markdown. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows me to format the text on this page using a simple syntax. It can create things like this list and the code block below. hugo new site mysite I\u0026rsquo;ve dabbled in Hugo. Hugo is a popular open-source static site generator. It was created in 2013 and generates static HTML files, so no database is required for server-side processing. You can learn more about Hugo by clicking here.\nI have used Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s cloud computing platform Azure before in various professional roles. This marks the first time using it personally to host something. Best of all, hosting a static website like this is free! Want to do the same for yourself? Check it out here\nLast but certainly not least is my use of Github! I\u0026rsquo;ve browsed Github and other repos while surfing the internet; this is the first time I\u0026rsquo;ve created my own repo. Feel free to check it out!\nThat\u0026rsquo;s all for now! I hope to have a few of these articles every month. They won’t always be about technology. My posts may cover other interests like basketball officiating and motorsports.\nDo you want to chat? Feel free to email me or reach out to me on LinkedIn!\nHappy Spring!\n","date":"13 April 2023","permalink":"/blog/hello-world/","section":"Blog","summary":"And it begins\u0026hellip;","title":"Hello World!"},{"content":"My name is Ian Carey, and I\u0026rsquo;m excited to share a little about myself with you.\nI am a IT Systems Engineer working for a Credit Union.
