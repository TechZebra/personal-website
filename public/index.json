I’ve enjoyed working in different labs, gaining knowledge and skills, and thinking about how to apply that knowledge to my current environment.\nAfter completing my first two Azure certifications and becoming a Microsoft Certified Azure Administrator, I was at a crossroads. I could either continue down the Microsoft path and gain more in-depth Azure knowledge or try another platform: AWS.\nI had several good friends within the “tech world” that I spoke to when making this decision. Ultimately, I was convinced to give AWS a shot and at least see what the world looked like outside of Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s ecosystem.\nEnter AWS Skill Builder. AWS Skill Builder is AWS’ repository of official training lessons to help you learn and refine your knowledge of AWS services. The video content and AWS Cloud Practitioner test exam were excellent preparation for the actual exam. Skill Builder also includes a game called “Cloud Quest.” Check out the video below!\nWhile I’m early in the training and learning process regarding AWS, I feel they have a real leg up on Microsoft here. Microsoft Learn is an incredibly robust platform with a ton of good information. Still, no live labs were included in the Azure certification training paths I participated in. I’d like to see Microsoft step up and offer more to individuals who want to train and learn.\nDue to these differences, I feel as though I made the right choice by jumping in to learn about AWS. I look forward to completing more labs and challenges within AWS Skill Builder and Cloud Quest.\nUntil next time,\nBe well!\n","date":"11 May 2023","permalink":"/blog/aws-cloudquest/","section":"Blog","summary":"Another quest starts!","title":"Playing Games and Getting Certified."},{"content":"Well, this is cool!\nThis isn\u0026rsquo;t the first time I\u0026rsquo;ve shared something online that nobody cares about; it is, the first time I\u0026rsquo;m doing it from my website!\nI decided to title this post \u0026ldquo;Hello World!\u0026rdquo; because I\u0026rsquo;m using several technologies for the first time to make it all happen.\nThe first technology is Markdown. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows me to format the text on this page using a simple syntax. It can create things like this list and the code block below. hugo new site mysite I\u0026rsquo;ve dabbled in Hugo. Hugo is a popular open-source static site generator. It was created in 2013 and generates static HTML files, so no database is required for server-side processing. You can learn more about Hugo by clicking here.\nI have used Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s cloud computing platform Azure before in various professional roles. This marks the first time using it personally to host something. Best of all, hosting a static website like this is free! Want to do the same for yourself? Check it out here\nLast but certainly not least is my use of Github! I\u0026rsquo;ve browsed Github and other repos while surfing the internet; this is the first time I\u0026rsquo;ve created my own repo. Feel free to check it out!\nThat\u0026rsquo;s all for now! I hope to have a few of these articles every month. They won’t always be about technology. My posts may cover other interests like basketball officiating and motorsports.\nDo you want to chat? Feel free to email me or reach out to me on LinkedIn!\nHappy Spring!\n","date":"13 April 2023","permalink":"/blog/hello-world/","section":"Blog","summary":"and it begins\u0026hellip;","title":"Hello World!"},{"content":"My name is Ian Carey, and I\u0026rsquo;m excited to share a little about myself with you.\nI am an IT Analyst working for a water utility.

It\u0026rsquo;s a thrilling experience, and I\u0026rsquo;m constantly learning and growing in my role.\nAnother one of my passions is motorsports.
